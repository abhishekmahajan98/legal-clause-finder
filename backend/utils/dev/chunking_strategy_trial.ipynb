Without prejudice to Clause 13.4, the Manager will maintain its own records of the Portfolio and transactions relating to the Portfolio to enable it to assess at any date, without undue delay, their nature and value. The Client acknowledges that valuation levels for the assets of the Portfolio in the periodic statements provided by the Manager in respect of the Portfolio shall reflect the Manager's good faith effort to ascertain fair market levels (including accrued income, if any) for the assets reasonably believed by the Manager to be held for the Portfolio based on pricing and valuation information believed by the Manager to be reliable. 18.5. The Manager may rely on an external data provider, Counterparty, CCP, Trade Repository or other third party to supply information or data of any kind, including derivative valuations. The Manager accepts no responsibility whatsoever (whether in contract, tort or otherwise, except to the extent that any such responsibility cannot be excluded by law) for Losses to the Client incurred as a consequence of the external data provider, Counterparty, CCP, Trade Repository or other third party supplying inaccurate information or data. 18.6. The Client acknowledges that variations in market conditions will mean that the prices shown in periodic statements and any other reports do not necessarily reflect realisable values. 18.7. The Manager will give the Client and its auditors all reasonable opportunity, during usual business hours of any Business Day on reasonable notice, to examine such part of the books and records (or an extract) of the Manager that relate directly to the Portfolio. 18.8.

The Manager will ensure that such transactions are effected on terms which are not materially less favourable to the Client than if the conflict or potential conflict had not existed. Any conflicts which the Manager is not able to prevent or manage effectively shall be promptly disclosed by the Manager to the Client. Except as required by the FCA Rules, neither the Manager nor any Affiliate shall be liable to account to the Client for any profit, commission or remuneration made or received from or by reason of such transactions or any connected transactions or to disclose the same or the identity of any other client or counterparty involved in such transactions, nor will the Manager's fees, unless otherwise provided, be abated. 20.2.

The Parties agree that damages may not be an adequate remedy for any breach of this Clause 29 and, accordingly, each shall be entitled (but not limited) to seek injunctive or other equitable relief restraining the other from breaching this Clause 29. 29.7. If the Client is a \"public authority\" for the purposes of section 3 of the FolA, it shall immediately notify the Manager if it: a) receives a request for information under section 8 of the FoIA which covers commercially sensitive or confidential information relating to the Manager, this Agreement or to the services provided under it; b) responds to such a request; c) receives a complaint in relation to the handling of such a request; d) becomes aware that an application has been made to the Information Commissioner (as defined in the FoIA) for a decision in relation to such a request; e) becomes aware that the Information Commissioner has served any notice on it under Part IV of the FoIA in relation to such a request; 18 For pension scheme Clients only. This reflects that, in the context of a pension scheme, the sponsoring employer usually participates in investment meetings and the development of investment strategy. This wording allows employers to do so without risking a technical breach of confidentiality requirements. 29 THE INVESTMENT ASSOCIATION f) becomes aware that an appeal has been made to the Information Tribunal (as defined in the FoIA) or the court in relation to such a request; or g) becomes aware that commercially sensitive or confidential information relating to the Manager, this Agreement or to the services provided under it has been or is about to be disclosed to a third party without the Manager's express written permission, and in each case shall provide the Manager with such details as reasonably may be requested by the Manager. When the Client has notified the Manager of the nature of the request received by the Client, the Client then agrees to give the Manager a reasonable opportunity to comment on whether an exemption from the requirement to disclose may be applicable and the Client shall take due regard of any such comments before making its response. The Manager agrees to respond in a timely manner. 29.8. In providing the services under this Agreement, neither the Manager, its Affiliates or a Delegate shall be obliged to disclose or to take into consideration (or to require any third party to disclose or take into consideration) any information: a) the disclosure or use of which might breach any prohibition, duty or confidence to any other person or arising under any applicable law; b) which comes to the notice of an employee, officer or agent of the Manager, its Affiliates or a Delegate, but properly does not come to the actual notice of an individual managing the Portfolio; or c) relating to the nature or extent of any interest the Manager or any Affiliate has in any investments. 30. Data protection 30.1. Each Party will comply with Data Protection Laws. 30.2. In order to provide the services the Manager or a Delegate may need to: a) communicate with the Client's trustees, owners, officers and employees (\"Client Contacts\") in relation to the services; b) process identification details of the Client Contacts in order to confirm their identities; c) check such Personal Data against databases of individuals who are subject to sanctions, classified as \"politically exposed persons\" or have committed crimes and to follow up any suspicions to ensure that the Manager complies with its anti-money laundering and terrorism obligations and to avoid fraud itself; d) record or monitor communications as set out in Clause 31; e) use such Personal Data to meet the Manager's compliance and regulatory duties; and/or f) transfer such Personal Data outside the UK and disclose it to anti-fraud organisations and law enforcement or regulatory agencies anywhere in the world, and the Manager will be acting as a data controller in respect of such processing. 30 MODEL DISCRETIONARY INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT 30.3. Where the Client provides the Manager with Client Contact details or where requested to do so by the Manager, the Client will notify such individuals that the Manager may need to process their Personal Data for the purposes set out in Clause 30.2. 30.4. The Manager will maintain a data protection fair processing notice on its website setting out the details of such processing and all other information required by, and in compliance with, Data Protection Laws, which the Client will also refer Client Contacts to when it makes a notification under Clause 30.3.19 30.5.

A copy of any such conversations with the Client and communications with the Client will be available on request for a period of five years (or, where requested by the FCA, for a period of up to seven years) from the date when the record is made. 31.2. The Manager will communicate with the Client [in English] and, subject to Clause 33, will communicate with the Client as considered appropriate, including through the Manager's website, by email or otherwise. [The Client hereby consents to receiving communications and reports under this Agreement (including but not limited to valuations) electronically online via the Manager's secure client website ([insert website link]).] The Client understands that if documents are only available online the Client will not receive a printed version. A paper copy of such communications and reports will be available to the Client upon request. 32. Force Majeure No Party to this Agreement shall be liable for any failure or delay in performing any of its obligations under or pursuant to this Agreement, and any such failure or delay in performing its obligations will not constitute a breach of this Agreement, if and to the extent that such failure or delay is due to an event of Force Majeure. 19 Note that the detail required by the UK version of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) as provided for under the Data Protection, Privacy and Electronic Communications (Amendments ETC) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 must be included in the Manager's website privacy policy. 20 Optional.

Subsequently, the Client may have a right to complain directly to the Financial Ombudsman Service. A copy of the Manager's complaints management policy is available on request and will otherwise be provided in accordance with the FCA Rules. 35. Compensation The Client may be entitled to compensation from the Financial Services Compensation Scheme if the Manager cannot meet its obligations. This depends on the type of business and the circumstances of the claim. Generally, a professional client will not be eligible for compensation. 36. Assignment and transfer 36.1. Save as provided in this Clause 36, neither Party may assign, transfer or novate, or purport to assign, transfer or novate, any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other Party, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed. 36.2.

Therefore, this Schedule 4 should be tailored accordingly.] Part A: EU EMIR [This Part is to be used where the Client is subject to obligations under EU EMIR and EU MiFIR.] Where the Manager is authorised pursuant to the Guidelines to enter into transactions in derivatives subject to the Guidelines and any Instructions, the following terms shall apply (unless otherwise agreed in writing between the Manager and the Client) in addition to those set out in the remainder of this Agreement: a) subject to the Order Execution Policy and the derivatives trading obligation under EU MiFIR, the Client authorises the Manager to effect transactions in derivatives with such Counterparties and CCPs and outside or on such markets as it reasonably considers appropriate. Where applicable, all such transactions shall be effected in accordance with the rules and regulations (if any) of the relevant market and the Manager may take all such steps as may be required or permitted by such rules and regulations and/or by appropriate market practice; b) the Manager shall select and use Counterparties or markets pursuant to paragraph (a) above in accordance with the Standard of Care (unless instructed by the Client to use a specific Counterparty or market, in which case the Manager shall have no responsibility for the selection or use of such Counterparty or market); c) notwithstanding paragraph (b) above, and except as agreed in the Guidelines, the Manager shall have no responsibility for monitoring the creditworthiness of any Counterparty or CCP after a transaction in derivatives has been entered into with such Counterparty or CCP and, in particular, shall not be required to terminate early or consider the early termination of any transaction in derivatives due to the creditworthiness of, or any other factors relating to, the relevant Counterparty or CCP and shall have no liability for any Losses arising out of any failure to terminate early a transaction in derivatives; d) the Client authorises the Manager to negotiate, amend, execute, sign or deliver on behalf of the Client all such documents including but not limited to agreements, master agreements, account opening documents, master confirmation agreements, confirmations, credit support documentation (whether by way of title transfer or by way of security, whether variation margin or initial margin, and whether to comply with regulations or otherwise), account control documentation and triparty collateral management documentation,24 clearing agreements, delegated reporting agreements, agreements with Trade Repositories or reporting intermediaries and other instruments as the Manager shall consider necessary or desirable to effect and manage such transactions in derivatives pursuant to the Guidelines; e) the Client authorises the Manager to give such representations and warranties including tax representations on behalf of the Client in relation to derivative transactions as are customary; 24 Parties to consider whether the Manager should have the ability to appoint a triparty collateral manager. 37 THE INVESTMENT ASSOCIATION f) the Client shall instruct the Custodian to act in accordance with instructions from the Manager including, but not limited to, making such payments or deliveries, pledging or debiting the Portfolio with any sums required to pay or supplement any deposit, margin, collateral or market support as may be required in respect of transactions in derivatives; g the Manager may allocate, novate, amend, terminate, settle, set-off or close-out such transactions in derivatives in its absolute discretion and without conferring with or obtaining the consent of the Client; h) the Client acknowledges that under the relevant agreement or any relevant rules of any market or CCP, the Counterparty's or CCP's recourse in the event of any Losses in relation to transactions in derivatives may not be limited to the assets of the Client in respect of the Portfolio; i) the Manager shall not be liable for any Losses arising from any default by, or lack of enforceability of any agreement against, the relevant Counterparty or CCP arising from the unenforceability of the termination, close-out, netting or credit support provisions of any agreement in the event of the default, insolvency or similar event of the relevant Counterparty or CCP; j) the Client acknowledges that the Client may be required to deliver upfront or initial collateral and variation margin, which will typically mean that the collateral or margin provided by the Client will be greater than the amounts due by the Client under the agreement and that the Client may rank as an unsecured creditor of the Counterparty or CCP to the extent of such over-collateralisation and the Client accepts that the need to meet collateral obligations may interfere with the Manager's ability to satisfy its investment objectives; k) the Client acknowledges that where collateral is delivered to the Counterparty or CCP by way of title transfer, the Client shall cease to have any proprietary interest in the collateral, the Client's recourse is solely to a debt claim against the Counterparty or CCP and the Client is unsecured for that debt claim. In addition, the Client is subject to the credit risk of the Counterparty in respect of any over-collateralisation. Such over-collateralisation may arise, amongst other reasons, because excess collateral has deliberately been provided (including, without limitation, by way of initial margin or upfront collateral), the value of the collateral has increased and the Counterparty or CCP has not returned the excess collateral prior to close-out, the value of the derivatives being collateralised has decreased and the Counterparty or CCP has not provided top-up collateral prior to close-out, or the Counterparty has defaulted before it discharges a collateral obligation to the Client in respect of the Client's exposure; 1) the Client acknowledges that obligations under EU EMIR and the trading obligation under EU MiFIR apply to it as the counterparty to a derivative transaction save as set out in such legislation.25 Notwithstanding the provisions applicable to the Manager in this Schedule 4, the Client will remain responsible for such obligations under such legislation.

Such information may include the Manager's mark-to-market or mark-to-model valuations;26 25 Where the Manager is an AIFM or UCITS management company, it also has obligations under EU EMIR. 26 The Manager should not agree otherwise where it is a UCITS management company or an AIFM in relation to OTC derivatives as defined in EU EMIR. 38 MODEL DISCRETIONARY INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT o) the Manager will maintain for five years following termination of each derivative details of that derivative as reported pursuant to paragraph (n) and/or provide to the Client such information so that the Client can maintain records in accordance with EU EMIR; p) the Manager shall enter into arrangements with Counterparties and/or CCPs for the clearing of derivative transactions where required under EU EMIR where the Manager enters into or novates the relevant derivative transactions that trigger the clearing obligation; q) the Manager shall have authority to decide, in its sole discretion (but subject to paragraph (p) above), which derivative transactions will be cleared, how and by whom, elect which type of account is used and manage their collateralisation in accordance with the Client's best interests and the Manager's regulatory obligations; r) the Manager will agree with Counterparties procedures for portfolio reconciliation and dispute resolution and manage such procedures as required by EU EMIR on behalf of the Client, provided that: i. the Manager will only be required to do so in relation to derivative transactions in the Portfolio and, in doing so, it will not take into account any other derivative transactions; and ii. if the Client needs to make a report to its competent authority, the Manager will, upon the Client's request, provide the necessary information to the Client but shall not make such report itself; s) the Manager will implement procedures for the purpose of confirming derivative transactions in the Portfolio with Counterparties within the timeframes under EU EMIR. Where such procedures involve the Counterparty generating the confirmation and the Counterparty fails to do so, the Manager is not liable for any Losses arising as a result. If the Client needs to make a report to its competent authority in relation to outstanding confirmations, the Manager will, upon the Client's request, provide the necessary information to the Client but shall not make such report itself; t) the Manager will analyse whether it is required to conduct a portfolio compression exercise and, if required, take the appropriate action as set out in EU EMIR; u) the Manager will mark-to-market or mark-to-model the value of derivative transactions within the Portfolio as required by EU EMIR and the Client shall be taken to agree to such valuations and any information and models used to determine them unless it notifies the Manager otherwise, in which case the Manager may cease to perform this obligation; v) the Manager will assist with the collateralisation of derivative transactions within the Portfolio as required by EU EMIR by ensuring that appropriate arrangements are in place with Counterparties and/or CCPs and managing the posting and collection of collateral using the assets in the Portfolio or such other assets as the Client may have made available for such purpose if required by the Manager. If no such assets are made available, the Manager reserves the right to terminate, close out, or reduce the size of the derivative transactions; w) the Manager and any Delegate is authorised to provide information about the Client and its derivative transactions to any other person where necessary or desirable for the Manager to perform its obligations under this Schedule 4 including Counterparties, markets, CCPs reporting intermediaries and Trade Repositories; x) notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement but without prejudice to Clause 22.4 of this Agreement, the Manager shall not be liable for any Losses incurred by the Client arising directly or indirectly from: i. the Manager's reasonable interpretation of the obligations under EU EMIR or EU MiFIR, which may be demonstrated by acting in accordance with market practice or on the advice of reputable counsel who have been properly instructed and informed of all the relevant facts; 39 THE INVESTMENT ASSOCIATION ii. the Manager's reasonable endeavours to assist the Client with its obligations under EU EMIR or EU MiFIR; or iii. any inaccurate, incomplete or misleading information provided by the Client, or any delay by the Client in providing information, to the Manager for the purposes of the Manager undertaking the actions described in this Schedule 4; and y) the Client represents, warrants and agrees, on the date of this Agreement and on a continuing basis, that it falls within each of the descriptions below that it has ticked and shall promptly notify the other Party if any representation ceases to be true, accurate or complete in any material respect:27 i. financial counterparty that exceeds any of the clearing thresholds in EU EMIR or has not calculated its positions against such thresholds (a \"Financial Counterparty\"); ii. small financial counterparty that has calculated its positions against the clearing thresholds in EU EMIR and does not exceed any of them (a \"Small Financial Counterparty\"); iii. Onon-financial counterparty that exceeds any of the clearing thresholds in EU EMIR or has not calculated its positions against such thresholds (a \"NFC+\"), in which case the Client shall inform the Manager in respect of which asset classes it exceeds the applicable clearing threshold; iv. non-financial counterparty that has calculated its positions against the clearing thresholds in EU EMIR and does not exceed any of them (a \"NFC-\"); V. Dan entity established in a third country that would be a Financial Counterparty if it were established in the EU; vi. vii. @ an entity established in a third country that would be a NFC+ if it were established in the EU, in which case the Client shall inform the Manager in respect of which asset classes it exceeds the clearing thresholds; viii. ix.

In addition, the Client is subject to the credit risk of the Counterparty in respect of any over-collateralisation. Such over-collateralisation may arise, amongst other reasons, because excess collateral has deliberately been provided (including, without limitation, by way of initial margin or upfront collateral), the value of the collateral has increased and the Counterparty or CCP has not returned the excess collateral prior to close-out, the value of the derivatives being collateralised has decreased and the Counterparty or CCP has not provided top-up collateral prior to close-out, or the Counterparty has defaulted before it discharges a collateral obligation to the Client in respect of the Client's exposure; 1) the Client acknowledges that obligations under UK EMIR and the trading obligation under UK MiFIR apply to it as the counterparty to a derivative transaction save as set out in such legislation.29 Notwithstanding the provisions applicable to the Manager in this Schedule 4, the Client will remain responsible for such obligations under such legislation.

Such information may include the Manager's mark-to-market or mark-to-model valuations;30 o) the Manager will maintain for five years following termination of each derivative details of that derivative as reported pursuant to paragraph (n) and/or provide to the Client such information so that the Client can maintain records in accordance with UK EMIR; p) the Manager shall enter into arrangements with Counterparties and/or CCPs for the clearing of derivative transactions where required under UK EMIR where the Manager enters into or novates the relevant derivative transactions that trigger the clearing obligation; q) the Manager shall have authority to decide, in its sole discretion (but subject to paragraph (p) above), which derivative transactions will be cleared, how and by whom, elect which type of account is used and manage their collateralisation in accordance with the Client's best interests and the Manager's regulatory obligations; 29 Where the Manager is an AIFM or UCITS management company, it also has obligations under UK EMIR. 30 The Manager should not agree otherwise where it is a UCITS management company or an AIFM in relation to OTC derivatives as defined in UK EMIR. 42 MODEL DISCRETIONARY INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT r) the Manager will agree with Counterparties procedures for portfolio reconciliation and dispute resolution and manage such procedures as required by UK EMIR on behalf of the Client, provided that: i. the Manager will only be required to do so in relation to derivative transactions in the Portfolio and, in doing so, it will not take into account any other derivative transactions; and ii. if the Client needs to make a report to its competent authority, the Manager will, upon the Client's request, provide the necessary information to the Client but shall not make such report itself; s) the Manager will implement procedures for the purpose of confirming derivative transactions in the Portfolio with Counterparties within the timeframes under UK EMIR. Where such procedures involve the Counterparty generating the confirmation and the Counterparty fails to do so, the Manager is not liable for any Losses arising as a result. If the Client needs to make a report to its competent authority in relation to outstanding confirmations, the Manager will, upon the Client's request, provide the necessary information to the Client but shall not make such report itself; t) the Manager will analyse whether it is required to conduct a portfolio compression exercise and, if required, take the appropriate action as set out in UK EMIR; u) the Manager will mark-to-market or mark-to-model the value of derivative transactions within the Portfolio as required by UK EMIR and the Client shall be taken to agree to such valuations and any information and models used to determine them unless it notifies the Manager otherwise, in which case the Manager may cease to perform this obligation; v) the Manager will assist with the collateralisation of derivative transactions within the Portfolio as required by UK EMIR by ensuring that appropriate arrangements are in place with Counterparties and/or CCPs and managing the posting and collection of collateral using the assets in the Portfolio or such other assets as the Client may have made available for such purpose if required by the Manager. If no such assets are made available, the Manager reserves the right to terminate, close out, or reduce the size of the derivative transactions; w) the Manager and any Delegate is authorised to provide information about the Client and its derivative transactions to any other person where necessary or desirable for the Manager to perform its obligations under this Schedule 4 including Counterparties, markets, CCPs, reporting intermediaries and Trade Repositories; x) notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement but without prejudice to Clause 22.4 of this Agreement, the Manager shall not be liable for any Losses incurred by the Client arising directly or indirectly from: i. the Manager's reasonable interpretation of the obligations under UK EMIR or UK MiFIR, which may be demonstrated by acting in accordance with market practice or on the advice of reputable counsel who have been properly instructed and informed of all the relevant facts; ii. the Manager's reasonable endeavours to assist the Client with its obligations under UK EMIR or UK MiFIR; or iii. any inaccurate, incomplete or misleading information provided by the Client, or any delay by the Client in providing information, to the Manager for the purposes of the Manager undertaking the actions described in this Schedule 4; and 43 THE INVESTMENT ASSOCIATION y) the Client represents, warrants and agrees, on the date of this Agreement and on a continuing basis, that it falls within each of the descriptions below that it has ticked and shall promptly notify the other Party if any representation ceases to be true, accurate or complete in any material respect:31 i. financial counterparty that exceeds any of the clearing thresholds in UK EMIR or has not calculated its positions against such thresholds (a \"Financial Counterparty\"); ii. iii. iv . small financial counterparty that has calculated its positions against the clearing thresholds in UK EMIR and does not exceed any of them (a \"Small Financial Counterparty\"); non-financial counterparty that exceeds any of the clearing thresholds in UK EMIR or has not calculated its positions against such thresholds (a \"NFC+\"), in which case the Client shall inform the Manager in respect of which asset classes it exceeds the applicable clearing threshold; non-financial counterparty that has calculated its positions against the clearing thresholds in UK EMIR and does not exceed any of them (a \"NFC-\"); V. an entity established in a third country that would be a Financial Counterparty if it were established in the UK; vi. vii. viii. ix.

I an AIFM of an AIF described above established in the UK; an occupational pension scheme as defined in section 1(1) of the Pension Schemes Act 1993 which is established in the UK; and/or the authorised entity responsible for managing and acting on behalf of the occupational pension scheme above. 31 Manager or Client to tick those statements that are true. 44 MODEL DISCRETIONARY INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT Part C: Neither EU EMIR and MiFIR nor UK EMIR and MiFIR [This Part is to be used where the Client is not subject to obligations under EU EMIR and EU MiFIR or UK EMIR and UK MiFIR.] Where the Manager is authorised pursuant to the Guidelines to enter into transactions in derivatives subject to the Guidelines and any Instructions, the following terms shall apply (unless otherwise agreed in writing between the Manager and the Client) in addition to those set out in the remainder of this Agreement: a) subject to the Order Execution Policy, the Client authorises the Manager to effect transactions in derivatives with such Counterparties and CCPs and outside or on such markets as it reasonably considers appropriate. Where applicable, all such transactions shall be effected in accordance with the rules and regulations (if any) of the relevant market and the Manager may take all such steps as may be required or permitted by such rules and regulations and/or by appropriate market practice; b) the Manager shall select and use Counterparties or markets pursuant to paragraph (a) above in accordance with the Standard of Care (unless instructed by the Client to use a specific Counterparty or market in which case the Manager shall have no responsibility for the selection or use of such Counterparty or market); c) notwithstanding paragraph (b) above, and except as agreed in the Guidelines, the Manager shall have no responsibility for monitoring the creditworthiness of any Counterparty or CCP after a transaction in derivatives has been entered into with such Counterparty or CCP and, in particular, shall not be required to terminate early or consider the early termination of any transaction in derivatives due to the creditworthiness of, or any other factors relating to, the relevant Counterparty or CCP and shall have no liability for any Losses arising out of any failure to terminate early a transaction in derivatives; d) the Client authorises the Manager to negotiate, amend, execute, sign or deliver on behalf of the Client all such documents including but not limited to agreements, master agreements, account opening documents, master confirmation agreements, confirmations, credit support documentation (whether by way of title transfer or by way of security, whether variation margin or initial margin, and whether to comply with regulations or otherwise), account control documentation and triparty collateral management documentation,32 clearing agreements, delegated reporting agreements, agreements with Trade Repositories or reporting intermediaries and other instruments as the Manager shall consider necessary or desirable to effect and manage such transactions in derivatives pursuant to the Guidelines; e) the Client authorises the Manager to give such representations and warranties including tax representations on behalf of the Client in relation to derivative transactions as are customary; f) the Client shall instruct the Custodian to act in accordance with instructions from the Manager including, but not limited to, making such payments or deliveries, pledging or debiting the Portfolio with any sums required to pay or supplement any deposit, margin, collateral or market support as may be required in respect of transactions in derivatives; g the Manager may allocate, novate, amend, terminate, settle, set-off or close-out such transactions in derivatives in its absolute discretion and without conferring with or obtaining the consent of the Client; h) the Client acknowledges that under the relevant agreement or any relevant rules of any market or CCP, the Counterparty's or CCP's recourse in the event of any Losses in relation to transactions in derivatives may not be limited to the assets of the Client in respect of the Portfolio; i) the Manager shall not be liable for any Losses arising from any default by, or lack of enforceability of any agreement against, the relevant Counterparty or CCP arising from the unenforceability of the termination, close-out, netting or credit support provisions of any agreement in the event of the default, insolvency or similar event of the relevant Counterparty or CCP; 32 Parties to consider whether the Manager should have the ability to appoint a triparty collateral manager. 45 THE INVESTMENT ASSOCIATION j) the Client acknowledges that the Client may be required to deliver upfront or initial collateral and variation margin, which will typically mean that the collateral or margin provided by the Client will be greater than the amounts due by the Client under the agreement and that the Client may rank as an unsecured creditor of the Counterparty or CCP to the extent of such over-collateralisation and the Client accepts that the need to meet collateral obligations may interfere with the Manager's ability to satisfy its investment objectives; k) the Client acknowledges that where collateral is delivered to the Counterparty or CCP by way of title transfer, the Client shall cease to have any proprietary interest in the collateral, the Client's recourse is solely to a debt claim against the Counterparty or CCP and the Client is unsecured for that debt claim. In addition, the Client is subject to the credit risk of the Counterparty in respect of any over-collateralisation. Such over-collateralisation may arise, amongst other reasons, because excess collateral has deliberately been provided (including, without limitation, by way of initial margin or upfront collateral), the value of the collateral has increased and the Counterparty or CCP has not returned the excess collateral prior to close-out, the value of the derivatives being collateralised has decreased and the Counterparty or CCP has not provided top-up collateral prior to close-out, or the Counterparty has defaulted before it discharges a collateral obligation to the Client in respect of the Client's exposure; 1) the Client acknowledges that it is responsible for compliance with obligations under any legislation that apply to it as the counterparty to a derivative transaction (including, without limitation, the reporting of transactions, maintenance of records and compliance with clearing obligations), and the Manager has no responsibility in relation to such obligations; m) the Client shall promptly provide the Manager with any information which the Manager reasonably requires and has requested from the Client to perform its obligations under this Schedule 4 and shall promptly inform the Manager if any such information changes; n) the Manager shall have authority in its sole discretion to decide which derivative transactions will be cleared, how and by whom, elect which type of account is used and manage their collateralisation in accordance with the Client's best interests and the Manager's regulatory obligations; o) the Manager will assist with the collateralisation of derivative transactions within the Portfolio by ensuring that appropriate arrangements are in place with Counterparties and/or CCPs and managing the posting and collection of collateral using the assets in the Portfolio or such other assets as the Client may have made available for such purpose if required by the Manager. If no such assets are made available, the Manager reserves the right to terminate, close out, or reduce the size of the derivative transactions; p) the Manager and any Delegate is authorised to provide information about the Client and its derivative transactions to any other person where necessary or desirable for the Manager to perform its obligations under this Schedule 4 including Counterparties, markets, CCPs reporting intermediaries and Trade Repositories; and q) notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement but without prejudice to Clause 22.4 of this Agreement, the Manager shall not be liable for any Losses incurred by the Client arising directly or indirectly from any inaccurate, incomplete or misleading information provided by the Client, or any delay by the Client in providing information, to the Manager for the purposes of the Manager undertaking the actions described in this Schedule 4. 46 MODEL DISCRETIONARY INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT Schedule 5 Manager and Client details With respect to the Manager: Address: [.] Telephone: [.] Attn: [.] [by reference to position] Email: [+] With respect to the Client: Address: [+] Telephone: [+] Attn: [+] [by reference to position] Email: [.] Client's process agent (where relevant): Address: [.] Telephone: Attn: [.] [by reference to position] Email: [+] 47 THE INVESTMENT ASSOCIATION Schedule 6 Securities financing transactions [Please note that not all Managers will provide all the services detailed in this Schedule and, where they do provide the services, they may not do so in the same way as described.
